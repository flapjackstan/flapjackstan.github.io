Hello!

Thanks for poking around my site and checking out my about me. My name is Elmer. I started my career working as a data collection manager in the military where I worked on stuff related to sensors, uavs, and satellites. I eventually went on to work as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. While in school, pre-pandemic, I decided to shift gears and work in public health as a data scientist. What made me transition was that I sensed there was a need for technical expertise in the industry and I was well equipped to help deliver the changes they wanted to make.  

I just finished graduate school with an ms in systems engineering and an mba and am now very interested in roles that involve stakeholder management and steering the wheel on some technical products. I would ideally like to point out some pitfalls I have come accross and implement best practices.

Outside of work, I like to play guitar and develop my coffee palette.

Please reach out at elm.s.camargo@gmail.com

TLDR;
- Work History: UAVs, Satellites, Sensors -> Software Engineering -> Data Science
- Education: MS + MBA
- Future: Stakeholder Management and Technical Products
- Personal: Guitar and Coffee
