Hello!

Thanks for poking around my site and checking out my about me. My name is Elmer and I am a data scientist interested in technical product management. I started my career in data science about 10 years ago working as a data collection manager in the military. I worked on stuff related to sensors, uavs, and satellites and prioritizing requests for information. I eventually went on to work as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. I then decided to shift gears and work in public health which is where I am now. I am a data scientist at the LA County Department of Public Health where I created and manage some api endpoints and a database to provide data to epidemiologists about community vaccination trends. On a day to day basis I'm working using github project management software, linux, python, and postgres. I am super happy that I made the change because I was able to make some strong gains using software and management skills I picked up at previous jobs; like putting more emphasis on planning docs, devops, and automated services all under the lens of data science and machine learning.

I just finished graduate school with an ms in systems engineering and an mba and am now very interested in roles with more stakeholder management and technical strategy. I already do work related to this, but I definitely see my career going towards that direction and I'm excited to explore it.  

Outside of work, I like movies, specialty coffee, and playing guitar.

TLDR;
- Work History: UAVs, Satellites, Sensors -> Software Engineering -> Data Science
- Education: MS + MBA
- Future: Stakeholder Management and Technical Products
- Personal: Movies, Guitar, and Coffee
