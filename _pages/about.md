Hello!

Thanks for checking out my about me. My name is Elmer. I am a data scientist at the LA County Department of Public Health. The team that I work with works provides data about community vaccination trends. Before I was data scientist, I worked as a software engineer in the aerospace industry, and before that I was in the military working on stuff related to sensors, uavs, and satellites. I am finishing up my last course in grad school and graduating with two degrees a masters in systems engineering and an mba. 

I am very interested in working in roles that include stakeholder management and steering the wheel on some technical products. I would ideally like to point out some pitfalls I have come accross and implment best practices.

Please reach out at elm.s.camargo@gmail.com
