# README

This is more so some notes on how to update and develop my site.

## How to get this to run on local
1. Run through install - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/
2. Run `bundle update` to get the dependencies for the project. You might need to remove or update strict versions.
3. Run `bundle install` and confirm all `gems` (packages) are installed
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run locally
   
## Workflow
Run locally, confirm site looks like what you want then push to prod

## Notes
- `Gemfile` lists dependencies for the project
- `chruby` manages different `ruby` versions
