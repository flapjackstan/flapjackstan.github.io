# Context
This was my final project for a class on healthcare analytics. The CDC publishes an annual survey that contains some data around risk factors and diagnosis of certain diseases. I took a two prong approach to model and communicate findings using a simple and explainable model and a more complex one used for classifying risk for diabetes. Below is a presentation and a report on the subject.
