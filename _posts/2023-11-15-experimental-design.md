# Context
This was the final project assignment for ISE 525. The class emphasized response surface methodolgy and its capstone was exploring a randomized response surface. The project began with an assignment of a response surface function that was accessed by a `.net` executable file. The `.exe` file then asks for trial inputs settings for various variables. I used fractional factorial designn and statistical optimization methodologies to find the optimal point on the multi-dimensional surface using minimal costly trials.
