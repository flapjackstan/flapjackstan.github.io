# Context

This was an assignment for a communications class that required a presentation based on an industry report of my choosing. I did some poking around and found out that Red Hat publishes a report and used that as my topic since I use open source technologies daily at work. 

A goal of the presentation was to center an audience who has little to no background on a topic and introduce them to industry trends and why an organization might adopt a practice. I walked the audience through an example of what an interaction in open source contribution looks like using a technology they were using in class (Data Science for Business Management) and described why companies adopt open source for emerging tech.
